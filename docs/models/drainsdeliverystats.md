# DrainsDeliveryStats

Delivery health of a drain over the last 24 hours, counted on finished deliveries (a delivery saved by an automatic retry counts once, as delivered): `failing` when more than 5 deliveries failed and they are at least 1% of all finished deliveries, `healthy` otherwise, and `unknown` when no delivery finished in the window.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { DrainsDeliveryStats } from "@vercel/sdk/models/getdrainsop.js";

let value: DrainsDeliveryStats = {
  attempts: 2305.84,
  failures: 8658.46,
  state: "failing",
  totalFailedDeliveries: 5890.8,
  totalRetriedDeliveries: 6560.8,
  totalSuccessfulDeliveries: 8218.76,
  window: "24h",
};
```
